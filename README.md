# YAML Config Diff Viewer

A web-based tool to visualize differences between YAML configuration files in a hierarchical tree structure.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Tree View**: Browse your YAML configs organized by folder structure
- **Real-time Diff Analysis**: See exactly which values differ between files at the same directory level
- **Web-based Interface**: Access via browser, perfect for remote SSH environments
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatically detects file changes (when file watcher works)
- **Manual Refresh**: Refresh button for manual updates

## Installation

1. **Create conda environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n yamltool python=3.10 -y
   conda activate yamltool
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask pyyaml watchdog
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   conda activate yamltool
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the web interface**:
   - Local access: http://localhost:5000
   - SSH port forwarding: `ssh -L 5000:localhost:5000 user@host`

## How it Works

### Tree Structure (Left Panel)
- Shows the folder structure of your `configs/` directory
- üìÅ Folders can be expanded to show contents
- üìÑ YAML files are displayed as leaves
- Click any folder or file to analyze differences

### Differences Panel (Right Panel)
- Shows configuration keys where values differ between files
- Files at the same directory level are compared
- Different values are highlighted
- Missing values are shown as "(missing)"

### Difference Detection Logic
- **Directory Level Comparison**: Files are grouped by directory level
- **Flattened Key Analysis**: Nested YAML structures are flattened to compare all keys
- **Value Comparison**: Values are compared as strings, highlighting differences
- **Missing Key Detection**: Shows when a key exists in some files but not others

## Example

For files in `configs/FedAML-Large-HI/`:
- `FedAML-Large-HI-MegaGNN-PNA-base.yaml`
- `FedAML-Large-HI-MegaGNN-PNA-cluster.yaml`

The tool will compare these files and show differences like:
- `seed: 42` vs `seed: 18`
- `wandb.use: True` vs `wandb.use: False`
- `federation.strategy: fedprox` vs `federation.strategy: fedavg`

## Configuration

The application is configured to read from `/home/letouwen/yamltool/configs/`. To change this:

1. Edit `app.py` line 227:
   ```python
   analyzer = YAMLDiffAnalyzer('/path/to/your/configs')
   ```

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Flask web server with Python
- **YAML Parsing**: PyYAML library
- **File Watching**: Watchdog library (optional, falls back to manual refresh)
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with responsive design
- **Styling**: Dark theme optimized for development environments

## Troubleshooting

### File Watcher Issues
If you see "inotify watch limit reached":
- The tool will still work with manual refresh
- Use the "Refresh" button to update after file changes
- To increase inotify limits: `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf`

### Port Already in Use
If port 5000 is busy, edit `app.py` and change:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001, use_reloader=False)
```

### No YAML Files Found
- Ensure your YAML files have `.yaml` extension
- Check the configs directory path in the application
- Verify file permissions
